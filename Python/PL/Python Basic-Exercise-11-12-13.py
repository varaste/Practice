Python Basic: Exercise-11 with Solution
Write a Python program to print the documents (syntax, description etc.) of Python 
built-in function(s).
Python Docstring:
A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, 
function, class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the __doc__ special 
attribute of that object.
All modules should normally have docstrings, and all functions and classes exported 
by a module should also have docstrings. 
Public methods (including the __init__ constructor) should also have docstrings.
